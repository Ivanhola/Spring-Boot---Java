This program will demonstrate usage of Spring Data REST.
Spring data rest automatically generates and gives us REST API endpoints for our defined entity
The only thing required is an entity and a repository for our entity & the spring data rest dependency

In this project we have an Employee entity, Spring data rest will automatically create a GET, POST, PUT, DELETE API under the
/employees
/employees/{}
just like our previous applications.

In this program we make use of Postman to send GET, DELETE, PUT, POST requests to our API
