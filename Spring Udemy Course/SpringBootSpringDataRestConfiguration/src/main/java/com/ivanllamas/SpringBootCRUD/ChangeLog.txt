This program is an extended version of
https://github.com/Ivanhola/Spring-Framework-Course-Learning/tree/master/Spring%20Udemy%20Course/SpringBootCRUDSpringDataREST
And we are going to configure some properties in the Spring Data Rest API

Step 1. Change the path from the default /employees to /members by going into our EmployeeRepository.java and adding an 
annotation
test it out in 
localhost:8080/api/members

Step 2. Change the default page size in application.properties
this will now display 3 elements in each page


run a test for http://localhost:8080/api/members?sort=lastName
this will sort in ascending order by lastName

run a test for http://localhost:8080/api/members?sort=firstName,desc
