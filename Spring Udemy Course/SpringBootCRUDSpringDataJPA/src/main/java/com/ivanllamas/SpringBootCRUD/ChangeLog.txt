This program will make use of Spring Data JPA, similar to https://github.com/Ivanhola/Spring-Framework-Course-Learning/tree/master/Spring%20Udemy%20Course/HibernateDemo
We will connect and use JpaRepository from Spring Data JPA

And use its integrated CRUD methods

Step 1. Create our JpaRepository in our DAO Package

Step 2. Create our Service to implement our JpaRepository in our Service Package,

Step 3. Fix our Rest Controller to inject the JpaRepository Service class, that allows us to use the CRUD methods we defined
