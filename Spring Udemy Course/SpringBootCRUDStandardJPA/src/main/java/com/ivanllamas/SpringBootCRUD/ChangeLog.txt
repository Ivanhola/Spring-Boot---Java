This program will make use of the Standard JPA. instead of the native hibernate API from our version 1 program.

Step 1. create an EmployeeDAOJPA implement class in our DAO package

The difference between this version and the Version 1, is that we use JPA implementation to run database queries using the EntityManager.
The program will still require A service interface that handles @Transactional, that calls the EmployeeDAO that then calls the EmployeeDAOJpaImplementation
which handles the database queries

The benefit of using this type of setup, is that if we needed to use another form of JPA, we can simple create a different class
to implement the EmployeeDAO and we wouldn't need to modify anything else
