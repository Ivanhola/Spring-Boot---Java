# Documentation for this Spring Boot Pet Clinic

__Spring Boot Pet Clinic__ is a project that is often used by the _Spring_ team, as a complete _reference project_ to the technologies that the Spring Framework has to offer, as well as 
the general structure and best practices to creating a Spring application. 

In this project, we will create our own __Pet Clinic__ and this will be our general purpose
reference project that integrates the use cases of general purpose Spring Framework technologies.

This project is built in a __Multi Module__ Maven format where we will split up the project into modules that contain _data for our database interactions_
and data displayed on the _web browser_.

### Technologies:
- Java
- Spring Framework (Spring Boot, Spring Data JPA, Spring MVC)
- MySql

- Maven (_Multi Module Model_)
- Thymeleaf
